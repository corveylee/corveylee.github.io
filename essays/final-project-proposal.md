# Final Program Project: DormU

# Overview
*The Problem*: Being a resident advisor (RA) in the on-campus dormatories, a common obstacle we face is building community and finding ways to build communication and connections throughout the floor. Although there have been steps to take a digital approach, most are too complex or lack features that would make it worth resident's use. 

*The Solution*: DormU is an application that allows UH housing residents within the same floor to connect and communicate with their RA as well as other members of the community.

# Approach
DormU requires a valid UH email as well as an assigned room code in order for users to sign up. This is in order to ensure validity of accounts as well as the ability to hold those accountable for their actions while on the platform.

The main feature of the site would be the main chat. Accessable to all students within that floor, it allows for quick communication throughout the floor as well as useful announcments for the RAs. This can be used for danger warnings as well as getting to know other members of the floor. There will also be a page for media so that residents are able to post videos and images of artwork, adventures, and more. 

DormU would work off of a friend system in order to allow private communication and group communication. The roommates would automatically be added through the use of the inital room code since they are already living in the same space. You can also add other residents through their individual code. Once they accept, then they are able to create study groups and communicate with other residents. The RA, however, will have full access to these conversations at any time. 

The profile page will also host infromation that would be useful to know. Residents would have the option to add their grade, major, as well as classes in order to have more information to connect with others. An achievement section could be used in order to show residents that have accomplished feats such as attending multiple programs or getting all of thier requirements completed. This would add a fun touch and an incentive to use the program. 

A big hurdle for this project is making it relevant for use. It is very difficult to get residents to sign up for most applications as it is too much of a hastle and it does not provide much features that are useful to the residents. Adding things such as background customization as well as features to build engagement and keep users on the platform. Also an easy to navigate UI would help with that, as it would be very easy to use. 

# Mockup Page Ideas
Some possible mockup pages include:

* Landing Page
* Home Page
* Profile Page
* RA (Admin) Page
* Connect page
* Media Page
* Friends Page
* Housing Page

# Use Case Ideas
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

Resident/Student:
* New user goes to landing page, and signs up using code for room that is assigned by RA.
* User gets a introduction page of "How to get started" (only shows up on first signup, accessable in profile page)
* User is put into profile to be able to fill in information
* User goes to connect page and is able to chat with other residents from the same floor
* User goes to media page and is able to see self-posted artwork, pictures, projects, and more
* User can easily see and access RA.
* User goes to housing page and is able to see monthly requirements and whether they have completed them or not

RA (Admin):
* Admin goes to landing page, and logs in
* Admin can see all conversations, even in group
* Admin is able to create new residents and assign them to room
* Admin is able to pin media as well as announcements in chat
* Admin is able to edit monthly requirements

# Beyond The Basics
* Content filtering and permission handling for unwanted content
* A calendar interface so that the RA is able to post local upcoming events.
* A networking system to connect with other floors/dormatories.
* A guest system for inviting friends (with limited capability).
* Security implementations to make it viable for limited use.
