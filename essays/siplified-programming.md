# Introduction
According to Forbes (*1), there are over 190 million active websites on the World Wide Web! With such ease of access to so many different webpages, it would make one believe that making a website is easy. While this is partially true, with HTML being very easy to pick up, making a good website is very difficult. For a website, there is a lot more to “good” than just the content of the page. Unlike a database, which is just numbers and code, a webpage holds graphics, images, and text. Each of these can further be formatted based on size, color, font, and more. Website design is a creative venture in itself, and it can take many hours of fiddling and recoding to get the desired look.

# So let’s speed it up. 
This is why we can use UI frameworks. These frameworks are already coded with predefined fonts, colors, and sizes that make the page look better while needing less time and effort from the programmer. This follows the principle that there are many elements that are already needed to be a certain size or a certain style, and we can easily implement them without needing to redo the tedious lines of code that have already been written for other websites. This can save many hours of recoding multiple different components, especially between many different projects. This does not, however, take away from the creativity needed to make a website eye-catching and engaging. While the tools are there, it is still up to the programmer to understand these different components and how to use them together in a way that is functional as well as appealing.

# Enter Bootstrap 5 
One specific tool that I had the chance to work with is Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 as a UI framework is very easy to implement into the program, just as simple as adding two extra lines of code for the stylesheet as well as the JavaScript scripts. Once you have these two lines in, you can access all of the classes in the Bootstrap stylesheet that can format the data however you would like. The class names and format are pretty intuitive, with the name of the class corresponding to different ways of formatting. This also means that you can easily format individual divs without needing to style each one inline. The other main feature of Bootstrap 5 is the ability to make content fluid. What this means is that the content will adjust based on the size of the viewport, or the visual screen. This is huge when it comes to making websites mobile-friendly or able to work on many different screen sizes. In addition to that, there is also an implementation for elements that change based on the size of the viewport. One of the most useful of these that I have used is a collapsible navbar, which will collapse the navigation bar into a dropdown menu when the viewport gets too small. This is perfect for mobile devices, which usually do not have the space to hold the full span of text.

# What are the trade-offs? 
The biggest trade-offs when using UI frameworks such as Bootstrap are the time spent on each. While manually coding in all of the margins, padding, and customization may take a very long time, it also takes a lot of time to learn the intricacies of Bootstrap. If you are just making a single webpage or the layout is very simple, it may prove easier to just use your own stylesheet and customization. For more widespread usage across multiple different platforms, the use of Bootstrap could be much more effective. Another big trade-off is customization. Although Bootstrap gives many customization options in regard to margins, colors, and fonts, the ultimate base design is still the same. This is why many top websites are not built using Bootstrap. If there are specific things you wish to get done, the use of Bootstrap may become a limiting factor. What is nice about Bootstrap, however, is that you can override the pre-built classes in order to fit your needs, but if you must override everything in the class, then it might make more sense to just build that class from scratch.

# Conclusion 
Making a website is hard. There are many factors to consider, and even a simple language such as HTML5 can become very convoluted very quickly. We can attempt to reduce the time taken to repeatedly recode a style sheet for every single project by using a stylesheet that has already been made and formatted to work how we want it to. Bootstrap 5 in particular uses classes to define every single customization option for an element. By stacking these classes, along with the possibility of stacking on your own classes, it provides many options for a quick and easy implementation. The use of UI frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 should be used as a helpful tool rather than being used as the entire basis for a website. There are just some things that are hidden under the hood of Bootstrap that I would like to implement or customize myself as the programmer. I believe that some Bootstrap classes, such as container, are useful in many parts of the code. Some smaller classes, however, are something that I would rather customize using my own stylesheet. It is a good tool to use in addition to your own styling, but ultimately it is very intricate and difficult to use in its full capacity.
