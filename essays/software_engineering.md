Software engineering is a common goal for many that like to work with computers. To be able to create something that functions and serves a purpose is a satisfying feeling. Not having to buy any materials or deal with physical objects allows for a lot of freedom to make anything. The ability to make a program to help myself, or to help others is the goal I hope to succeed in this class. The ability to create any program under a set of constraints can allow anything to be possible and can make complex jobs trivial.

To be able to make these softwares, I hope to improve my ability to work with languages such as Javascript/Typescript and other web devlopment languages. While programs that run locally are good for situational problem-solving, programs that can enlist in the use of networks have a potential to do a lot more. To be connected to the internet and the cloud allows for a bigger database, faster processing, and other systems that would not be possible without it. It is these software that affect our daily lives and it is this software that allows us so much ease in everything that we do.

In addition to learning new languages I hope to flesh out my professional portfolio. By developing this website as well as my professional platforms like LinkedIn, I hope to market myself in a way that interests potential employers. In addition, it gives credit to the work that I have spent so much time on for my previous courses or done on my free time. By doing this, it allows potential employers to see my skillset and how I have applied it into projects of my own. This combined with my essays show my profeciency in computing.
