Typescript is a language used primarily in web development as an alternate to Javascipt. As a variant to Javascript, it's main focus is to establish types to prevent illegal changing of variables. This allows for better security and to prevent against errors when programming. Seeing it's usefulness, it has become a standard among many different software making companies. 

Seeing as I have not used Typescript or Javascript, both offered their own challenges and setbacks while trying to learn them. Javascript felt much like python, in that you did not have to specify your type. This kind of style was much easier to code, but it had many setbacks when it came to readability and the ability to recognize errors. There is a lot more chance to assign the wrong type to a variable, which will almost always throw an error somewhere down the line. Even when things are coded correctly, it can be very difficult to read as there is a lot of interpretation that has to be done, which can make it very difficult to troubleshoot, especially with those that have not seen the code before. 

Typescript came in to solve these deficienies. Instead of langauges like C or Java, where the type is declared before the variable name, the type is declared after the variable name in Typescript. This provides about the same readability as other languages, but it is something new to remember from a developing standpoint. There is definitely a lot more syntax I have to remember, but my knowledge of C and Java really helps me to understand the logic and how to strategically get my programs to do what they are trying to do. Overall, once I can recall how to write the syntax for variables as well as the optimization techniques that are described in the Typescript manual, I will be well on my way to professionally developing in Typescript.
