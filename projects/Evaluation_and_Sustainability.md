In Hawai'i, modern economy is driven by tourism and business that were established since the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. The overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy itself was a response to more economical rights for Americans rather than the Hawaiian people and monarchy. This trend has been a repeated cycle since the introduction of colonial power in Hawaii with the arrival of captain cook in the 1800's. As we have entered the modern era of Hawai'i, these colonial powers are still present and have a significant impact on the economy in Hawaii. 

One of the big concepts listed here is the idea of settler responsiblity and impacted groups in Hawai'i. This slideshow focuses on the text written by Lauren Ballesteros-Watanabe, founder of Sierra Club of Hawai ªi and her interview with Rebekah, a white settler of Hawai'i that goes through a journey of self-discovery and her impact as a settler of Hawai'i and what she can do in her position to realize the falsities of the perspective of Hawai'i and to understand the struggles of the indigineous community in Hawai'i.

The other aspect of this slideshow details the need for change and how Hawai'i can begin to move towards a more sustainable society. This includes learning from the sustainable past of Hawai'i before contact, as well as working together with other communities to establish common ground and develop a system that supports everyones' asperations and goals. Overall, this project aimed to summarize many of the reasons for change in Hawai'i and methods to accomplish that goal.
