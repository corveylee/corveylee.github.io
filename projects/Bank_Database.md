The bank database program was a program designed to showcase a multitude of skills in c and later c++ by creating a fully functional banking database and interactive user interface. The database would a singly linked-list collection of records sorted in order by account number, meaning that each record would point to the next available record sequentially. 

This is a Bank Database program that runs on your local machine. It takes existing information from a file (or creates a new one) and interprets it into accounts within the database. The user is then free to add, remove, find, or print all records. Once the user is done, all information is updated to the database file. 

This project was done as a solo endeavor. I was the one that wrote and tested this program using C in UH Unix. AI was not used as a resource when making this project.

From this experience, I learned how to combine requirements and constraints in order to produce a program very similar to one that would need to be coded for a bannking company. In addition, I got to combine my knowledge of coding in C as well as my knowledge of Databases and structures in order to write a program that could write to files, store information into a linked list, and manipulate information stored. Overall, the experience was very enjoyable and it taught me a lot about coding and how to approach writing code.
