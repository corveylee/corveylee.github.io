summary: "My team developed a software to practice encoding and sending encoded messages across a network."

Encryption is the process of changing information in order to make it unrecognizable to others who view it. This is usually done through mathematical manipulation, where letters are changed according to a mathematical key, and can't be decoded without the same or another key. This process of anonimity makes for safer communication, better integrity on networks, and ensures that a message was sent by the person that it is claimed to be. For my ICS 311 course, this was the focus for this assignment, as we had to create an implementation of encoding in any language of our choosing. 

For this project, I was in charge of creating and documenting the part of the program that focused on sending an encrypted message and ensuring that the message was original by decoding and then reencoding the message, checking for equality. The assignment had RSA as a requirement to use so we used a python RSA module along with matplot library in order to implement a network that could send and recieve messages. The rest of the assingment was straightforward and used simple logic to encode and decode the message and to check for equality.
